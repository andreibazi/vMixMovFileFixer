**MOV video fixer for vMix
Alpha files rendered from After Effects end up with a limited color range, and vMix has trouble correctly interpreting them to use as mattes.
These bat files help you encode them in the correct full range video format that works well in vMix.

**Usage
1. Clone the repo;
2. Place your files in the folder you cloned in;
3. Run the apropiate bat script (RGB / RGB_plus_alpha if you need transparency);
4. Your encoded files will be in ./result;
